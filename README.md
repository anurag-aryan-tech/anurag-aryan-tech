# 👋 Hi, I'm Anurag Aryan

I'm a student genuinely learning to code and improving step by step. I use this profile to document my progress and build small projects as I learn.

## What I'm Learning
- Python fundamentals
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Django basics for web development
- Git and GitHub workflow

## Repositories
- AboutMe — introduction and what I’m focusing on
- Coding-Journey — honest notes, small projects, and realistic learning plans
- Learning-Log — DSA practice notes and problem-solving approaches

## How I Work
- Consistency over hype: I focus on steady improvement
- Honesty over metrics: no inflated numbers or fake achievements
- Learn by doing: build small, useful things while learning

## Current Focus (short-term)
- Strengthen Python and problem-solving
- Build a basic CRUD app with Django
- Practice fundamental DSA topics (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues)

## Connect
- GitHub: https://github.com/anurag-aryan-tech
- LinkedIn/Twitter: I’ll add links when I’m actively using them

Thanks for visiting! Suggestions and beginner-friendly resources are always welcome.
